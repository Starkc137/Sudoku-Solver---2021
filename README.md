## Input / Output
### Input
The program reads a Sudoku from stdin (using cin). it reads n integers, each separated by
spaces. It will contain values in {0, 1, . . . , n}. If a cell contains a 0 then treat that cell as blank. The program
should be able to handle Sudoku of various sizes:
• 9 × 9 – {0, 1, . . . , 9},
• 16 × 16 – {0, 1, . . . , 9, A, . . . , F}, and
• 25 × 25 – {0, 1, . . . , 9, A, . . . , P}.
The input will always be valid, and you do not need to handle special cases with strange whitespace, etc.
Note that in competitive programming competitions and when programming generally, you should always
check that the input is both valid and formatted correctly.
### Output
The program outputs the solved Sudoku with all the values separated by spaces, or if there is no solution,
the program outputs the text "No Solution"
